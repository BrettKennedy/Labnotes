#Running to do list
+ Add MuTect2 into Loeb Snakemake workflow
+ Check MuTect2 output for 100% Tumor Colo Sample, and create ROC curve.
    + Work on code to generate the FM/FP plots.
    + Create code to generate ROC curves overall
+ Run cutadapt prior to barcode collapse with BMFtools, and compare to run where cutadapt comes after collapse.
+ Run MarkDuplicatesWithMateCigar on Loeb data, preferably the 100% tumor, same as the TruSeq run.  Be sure ot use a sample that is run through cutadapt first. (**DONE**)
+ Run translocation pipeline on the ctDNA sample
+ Create analysis snakemake workflow
+ Demultiplex new HiSeq runs, Swift and Inline (**IDT Inline DONE**)

##TruSeq 16N Adapter diagnosis

finished running all PCR duplicate removal tools on the two samples.  This table compares the outcomes.

| PCR Dup Removal Method | Library                | Mean DoC |
|------------------------|------------------------|----------|
| BMFtools + Rescue      | Colo829_100T inline    | 624.74   |
| BMFtools + Rescue      | Colo829_100T secondary | 20369.34 |
| Picard Tools MarkDupMC | Colo829_100T inline    | 610.97   |
| Picard Tools MarkDupMC | Colo829_100T secondary | 1577.9   |
| USEQ (Nix)             | Colo829_100T secondary | 29489.92 |

For some reason, the BMFtools coverage dropped drastically.  What the hell happened there?  This is in the cutadapt dataset, could that have dropped coverage by 1000x?  That seems unlikely.


##Snakemake/Pipeline2.0
Keep up to date on SOPs for Snakemake, uploaded them to Confluence.  

At the meeting today, someone suggested we move

##Biocomputing Operations
I accept the position of interim associate director of biocomputing.  This will likely add some addministrative stuff to my current responsibilities.  I want to what is best by the department and am deeply saddened by the departure of David Nix.

We had a meeting at 9am to discuss the future of the department, with Elaine Gee as acting director, and myself as assoc director.  

Here's my admin to do list
+ Meet with Nix and make a list of projects and responsibilities
+ Look at job posting for Nix's job, have him look at it as well.  
+ Set up a meeting with Barry Moore to discuss hiring outgoing people from that group, as well as shaping future collaborations, might also mention a potential symposium, sponsored by ARUP with the USTAR group.
+ Meet with Elaine and outline the responsibilities of the Director and Associate Director of Biocomputing.  What do I want this job to be?  What needs to get done.
