# Running to do list
(somehow this keeps getting longer and not shorter)
+ Add MuTect2 into Loeb Snakemake workflow
+ Check MuTect2 output for 100% Tumor Colo Sample, and create ROC curve.
    + Work on code to generate the FM/FP plots.
    + Create code to generate ROC curves overall
+ Run cutadapt prior to barcode collapse with BMFtools, and compare to run where cutadapt comes after collapse.
+ Run translocation pipeline on the ctDNA sample
+ Create analysis snakemake workflow
+ Run analysis pipeline for IDT Inline HiSeq Run
+ Run collapse and alignment pipeline on the Swift data (**done for all but NA12878**)
+ Carefully read CAPP-Seq paper, identify useful methods, assess our current approach.
+ Run new Inline barcode samples through MuTect2, in particular the new normals, etc.
+ re-run Strelka on these samples as well, with the new bed file.

## Align and collapse Swift libraries
The CHPC has been hit hard overnight, so none of my jobs even started, which is disappointing.  I probably wont' have BAMs for Keith by the end of the day.

I've finally been able to get bmftools to install on the local SLURM cluster
ngs-prod-head1, using a bunch of cludgy hacks inside anaconda.  It's gross, but looks liek it'll work.

Completed the initial meta-analysis of the IDT created inline barcodes.  There are a couple of unusual things to this library. the RV counts don't seem to follow any pattern.

Looks like I'm once again missing half the reads.  Dammit.  I'm not sure how this happened, I followed Illumina's instructions very carefully.  I'll need to re-demultiplex.
