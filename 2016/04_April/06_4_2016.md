#Running to do list
(somehow this keeps getting longer and not shorter)
+ Add MuTect2 into Loeb Snakemake workflow
+ Check MuTect2 output for 100% Tumor Colo Sample, and create ROC curve.
    + Work on code to generate the FM/FP plots.
    + Create code to generate ROC curves overall
+ Run cutadapt prior to barcode collapse with BMFtools, and compare to run where cutadapt comes after collapse.
+ Run translocation pipeline on the ctDNA sample
+ Create analysis snakemake workflow
+ Run analysis pipeline for IDT Inline HiSeq Run
+ Run collapse and alignment pipeline on the Swift data (**done for all but NA12878**)
+ Carefully read CAPP-Seq paper, identify useful methods, assess our current approach.
+ Run new Inline barcode samples through MuTect2, in particular the new normals, etc.
+ re-run Strelka on these samples as well, with the new bed file.

##Note:  I'll be dumping my usual daily notebooks to split the tracking of the hand-done FASTQ -> processed bams for both the Swift and IDT libraies.  In this notebook, I'll be tracking the IDT inline step by step

##IDT Inline Barcodes Manual_Test
I'll run this analysis step by step, with no pipes, and a read count at each step.
