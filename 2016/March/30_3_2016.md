#Running to do list
+ Add MuTect2 into Loeb Snakemake workflow
+ Check MuTect2 output for 100% Tumor Colo Sample, and create ROC curve.
    + Work on code to generate the FM/FP plots.
    + Create code to generate ROC curves overall
+ Run cutadapt prior to barcode collapse with BMFtools, and compare to run where cutadapt comes after collapse.
+ Run translocation pipeline on the ctDNA sample
+ Create analysis snakemake workflow
+ Demultiplex Swift HiSeq Run
+ Run analysis pipeline for IDT Inline HiSeq Run
+ Carefully read CAPP-Seq paper, identify useful methods, assess our current approach.
+ Create new bed file for the new V3 ctDNA/Solid Tumor bed file, adding in probes for Colo829 mutations.
