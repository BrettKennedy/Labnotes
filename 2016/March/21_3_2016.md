###To Do's from Friday:
+ Check for problems from the bmftools error
+ continue to try to get MarkDuplicateWithMateCigar to work (probably move up to chpc for analysis)
+ continue to work on bed files to make sure all of the regions needed are there (**DONE**)
+ work on variant calling, see if I can get the basics done for the 100% tumor samples
    + call variants on the 100% colo829 from the Loeb data.
    + Create the FM/FP plots that Keith suggested last Wednesday for the targeted variants

###Aligning truseq data without barcodes and collapsing using picard's MarkDuplicateWithMateCigar (continued)

moving analysis to chpc.

    /uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/arup-storage1/u0521163/ctDNA_Data/HiSeq_TruSeq_Colo/no_barcodes

ran out of memory on ember, re-launching on kingspeak
ran using the bash scripts found in that directory and using the same sbatch script found there as well.
found that the BAM must be coordinate sorted (I thought it was), before being marked.

future runs of this tool should use

    java -jar /uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/ucgdstor/common/apps/ember.arches/picard/1.130/picard.jar RevertOriginalBaseQualitiesAndAddMateCigar \
        SORT_ORDER=coordinate \
        I=01_100Colo829_TS16N_noBS.bam \
        O=01_100Colo829_TS16N_noBS_MCtag.bam


###Snakemake

Attended meeting to discuss and outline Snakemake SOP.

To do:
+ add mutect2 variant calling to workflows
+ re-create workflow without wild cards
+ create joint ruleset on the github page

###Bed file problems
Created a new bed file contained the additional probes found in

    /home/brett/projects/BMFTools_Devel/Panel/extended_panel/designed-probe-coords-chr.sort.bed

by this command

    cat temp_desinged.bed ctDNA_V2_Probe-sequences_8-7-15_noCHR_sort.bed | bedtools sort -faidx ../names.txt -i - | bedtools merge -i - > ctDNA_V2_probes_with_colo829_dopes.bed

the sample now appears to contain the proper probes.  Not sure what I did wrong before, but I'll need to re-run MuTect2 and any other analyses that use bed locations.
