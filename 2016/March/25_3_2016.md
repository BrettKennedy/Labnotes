#Running to do list
+ Add MuTect2 into Loeb Snakemake workflow
+ Check MuTect2 output for 100% Tumor Colo Sample, and create ROC curve.
    + Work on code to generate the FM/FP plots.
    + Create code to generate ROC curves overall
+ Run cutadapt prior to barcode collapse with BMFtools, and compare to run where cutadapt comes after collapse.
+ Run MarkDuplicatesWithMateCigar on Loeb data, preferably the 100% tumor, same as the TruSeq run.  Be sure ot use a sample that is run through cutadapt first.
+ Run translocation pipeline on the ctDNA sample
+ Create analysis snakemake workflow
+ Demultiplex new HiSeq runs, Swift and Inline


##TruSeq 16N Adapter diagnosis
/home/brett/projects/BMFTools_Devel/Experimental_Data/HiSeq_TruSeq_Colo829/no_barcodes/Loeb

I've asked Ashini to run Nix's barcode method on the CHPC, because I haven't been able to get his snakemake scripts to complete succesfully.  It's not worth the continued time to trouble shoot them.

I've moved analysis of the inline barcode data onto my local machine, because CHPC has been too buys.  I've also updated to the latest picard tools, hope that it would resovlve the sorting problem I saw yesterday.  I should probably have thought of that earlier.  I ran traditional picard MarkDuplicates on the inline data as well, followed by DoC:

**Mean depth of coverage after picard MarkDuplicates: 610.54**

This is about 1/3 as we see when we collapse based on barcodes, suggesting that this very agressively removing reads.  I'll need to compare this with MarkDuplicatesWithMateCigar to get a better asnwer.  I may want also to run samtools rmdup on the same samples.


##Staff Meeting
Dean Li pointed out the challenges facing our department and our company, as well as the opportunities for growth.  These challenges seem more daunting with the loss of our fantastic director, David Nix.

##Demultiplex HiSeq Runs
Gligorich has started the new HiSeq runs for the Swift adapters as well as some additional real ctDNA samples on the inline barcodes.  Info from Keith.


IDT Inline (10N:11N):

\\genetics\raw$\HiSeq_BMF\160324_D00784_0033_AHJMK7BCXX

https://hci-bio-app.hci.utah.edu/gnomex/gnomexFlex.jsp?requestNumber=12316R

Read 1 = 137
Index 1 = 8
Index 2= 8
Read 2 = 137

SWIFT:

https://hci-bio-app.hci.utah.edu/gnomex/gnomexFlex.jsp?requestNumber=12318R

Read 1 = 137
Index 1 = 7 cycles (use 6 bases for de-multiplexing)
Index 2 = 9 cycles (molecular barcode)
Read 2 = 137


I'll need to review my previous discussions with Illumina and figure out where I had demultiplexed this data.
