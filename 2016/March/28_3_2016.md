#Running to do list
+ Add MuTect2 into Loeb Snakemake workflow
+ Check MuTect2 output for 100% Tumor Colo Sample, and create ROC curve.
    + Work on code to generate the FM/FP plots.
    + Create code to generate ROC curves overall
+ Run cutadapt prior to barcode collapse with BMFtools, and compare to run where cutadapt comes after collapse.
+ Run MarkDuplicatesWithMateCigar on Loeb data, preferably the 100% tumor, same as the TruSeq run.  Be sure ot use a sample that is run through cutadapt first.
+ Run translocation pipeline on the ctDNA sample
+ Create analysis snakemake workflow
+ Demultiplex new HiSeq runs, Swift and Inline
